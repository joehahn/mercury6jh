mercury6.2jh is John Chamber's mercury6_2.for code, but tweaked slightly
to suit my purposes. Those tweaks include additional forces to
drive orbit decay and/or planet-migration. Go to http://www.arm.ac.uk/~jec/
to download John Chamber's original Mercury6.2 code, and consult
his manual for instructions on how to use his code. And to take advantage
of my tweaks to his code, have a look at the first few lines of 
mercury6.2jh.for.

Also included in this package are a number of IDL codes that I use
to read and inspect the output that is generated by mercury6.2jh. Those
*.pro codes do mostly work GDL (the Gnu version of IDL), but they do generate
a number of warnings and not all of the calculations are successful. But I
suspect that these IDL codes could easily be adapted to run in both IDL & GDL.

Those codes are:

g77_compile		this file contains the unix command that I use to 
			compile mercury6.2jh with the g77 compiler on my linux desktop PC

g95_compile             another compilation using the g95 compiler 

gfortran_compile	ditto

demo.pro		this idl batch file illustrates the use of the following 
			IDL subroutines. First run mercury6.2jh using the included
			*.in input files, then run demo.pro in IDL, via IDL> @demo 

read_mercury6.pro	read the output of mercury6.2jh, as well as Chamber's
			original mercury6_2 code

xv2el.pro		convert heliocentric cartesian coordinates to 
			orbit elements

bary2_coords.pro	convert heliocentric coordinates to barycentric 
			coordinates

energy2.pro		calculate the system's total energy

angular_momentum.pro	calculate the system's total angular momentum

jacobi2.pro		calculate the particles' Jacobi integrals
